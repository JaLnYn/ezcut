[transcript:00:03:23] it has to be like, no. I was on the ground and it still appears through. Building for instance turns
[transcript:00:03:32] weapons grade uranium into uranium metal which forms the core of a nuclear weapon. Rebuilding it
[transcript:00:03:39] could take up to a year. However, the real problem remains. The Fordo fuel enrichment plant is
[transcript:00:03:48] buried deep inside a mountain near KOM. Encaiced and reinforced concrete, the facility is believed
[transcript:00:03:54] to be beyond the reach of any Israeli weapon known to exist. It was built in secret and only
[transcript:00:04:00] publicly unveiled in 2009. Since then, Fordo has been at the center of international attempts
[transcript:00:04:08] to curb Iran's nuclear program. But Iran has other ultra-secure facilities to rely on besides Fordo.
[keyframe:00:04:13] The video frame features a detailed map highlighting Iran, marked with several warning symbols indicating nuclear sites. Labels such as "Tehran Research Reactor" and "Yazd uranium mine" are visible, suggesting locations of interest concerning nuclear activity.

(Cluster 48, Size: 11)
[transcript:00:04:48] believed to offer more floor space. Iran has barred the IAA from inspecting the site. So most of what
[transcript:00:04:56] is known about Pekax comes from open source leaks and a fair amount of speculation. However,
[transcript:00:05:03] if Iran decided to assemble a nuclear weapon while under attack, this is the place they would do it.
[transcript:00:05:10] Conventional bombs simply can't reach it. Israel's best bunker busters like the US Supply GPU-28
[transcript:00:05:18] can penetrate up to six meters of concrete. But that is nowhere near enough for the hardened
[transcript:00:05:23] chambers of Pekax or even Fordo. The only weapon that stands a chance of getting through is the
[transcript:00:05:31] GPU-57. Can you give a shout out to my boy for being 30 minutes sober?
[transcript:00:05:35] Your job there, Jim, it's been 30 minutes sober, man. Also, chat, wait, 30 minutes.
[transcript:00:05:39] Huh?
[transcript:00:05:43] A thousand kilogram bomb can smash through 61 meters of concrete.
[transcript:00:05:48] Yeah, but chat, why did they just come off the power supply?
[transcript:00:05:50] Chat, it needs a lot of power to do all that. No, why did they just come off the power?
[transcript:00:05:54] It's the most sophisticated bunker buster we know of. But only the US Air Force can deploy it,
[transcript:00:06:01] using the B2 bomber. No other aircraft is configured to carry it and Israel has no B2 bombers.
[transcript:00:06:09] So to destroy Iran's nuclear programs, Natanz, Fordo and Pekax will have to be taken down.
[transcript:00:06:16] And only Americans can show the trigger. Admittedly, air power alone may not be enough.
[transcript:00:06:22] Special forces would have to be deployed on the ground to confirm the destruction of each site,
[transcript:00:06:27] but the bottom line is that American involvement, especially in aerial operations, is inevitable.
[transcript:00:06:38] Most of the US tanker aircraft,
[transcript:00:06:41] other than the new one, Spain and Germany at bases that typically serve as launch pads for operations
[transcript:00:06:47] in the Middle East. Moral airbase in Spain is one such example. It is a place where tanker
[transcript:00:06:54] aircraft specialize in taking off to refuel B2 bombers in the air. Doing so would then allow the
[transcript:00:07:01] bombers to keep flying to the Middle East to carry out attacks. So what we're seeing is the
[transcript:00:07:07] formation of an air corridor designed to sustain a prolonged assault. A fleet of 32 tankers can
[transcript:00:07:15] be deployed on the ground. That's over 200 combat aircraft in the air at the same time.
[transcript:00:07:19] There is no need for that kind of support in a region.

[transcript:00:07:30] and they do air refueling and whatnot, and it just keeps going on a cycle over and over again.
[transcript:00:07:35] It has a massive footprint. So either America is preparing to strike Iran directly,
[transcript:00:07:40] or it is setting up a refueling mission over Iraq or Syria to let Israeli jets
[transcript:00:07:47] carry more bombs instead of external fuel tanks. The latter is a lot more like they're just
[transcript:00:07:53] posturing it, which is enough of a move to do whatever it's not to achieve with this agenda,
[transcript:00:07:58] whatever, right? And it's not to be carried out. The safer bet for the United States.
[transcript:00:08:04] With that many US tanker aircraft refueling Israeli jets, Israel can begin the second phase of
[transcript:00:08:10] the war, the Dahia doctrine. And from here things get dark really fast. The Dahia doctrine is a

[transcript:00:09:24] area of assault. The casualties would be enormous. Already a mass exodus of civilians is underway
[transcript:00:09:30] with many fleeing Tehran for safer ground. The doctrine violates key principles of international
[transcript:00:09:38] law, namely the distinction between civilians and combatants, the requirement for proportionality

[transcript:00:17:48] I'm a negative chef, but this, I think they're trying to pull out pull a Mario.
[transcript:00:17:52] Was it cold? I forgot the other Mario that they made that was kind of big.
[transcript:00:17:56] With Donkey Kong.
[transcript:00:17:57] And Donkey Kong is losing a lot of his identity.
[keyframe:00:17:58] The video frame features a man in a room, likely live-streaming as seen by his setup and the overlayed text. The main focus is a colorful video game environment resembling a platformer, with a character navigating a large, T-shaped structure floating amidst a cloudy, pastel sky and distant whimsical platforms. The mood is playful and engaging, blending the cozy, focused atmosphere of the streaming setup with the vibrant, imaginative game visuals. (Cluster 33, Size: 44)
[transcript:00:18:00] And it feels like they're just random Mario worlds for Donkey Kong.
[transcript:00:18:05] That's kind of like now a random everything character.
[transcript:00:18:09] And it's just kind of like what I think it loses its soul.
[transcript:00:18:11] This is not Donkey Kong Country.
[transcript:00:18:13] This isn't old school.
[transcript:00:18:14] Who is Donkey Kong is a guy that sits on a cart,
[transcript:00:18:18] which fucking with Diddy Kong.

[transcript:00:19:03] I don't think I'll play this, but it looks, it looks all right.
[transcript:00:19:04] I mean,
[transcript:00:19:06] yeah, if you're gonna play this game, I mean,
[transcript:00:19:10] good.
[transcript:00:19:12] I don't even know what to say about it.
[transcript:00:19:15] Good for you.
[transcript:00:19:16] Good for you.
[transcript:00:19:16] I hope you enjoy your game.
[transcript:00:19:17] I'll be happy to see.

(Cluster 27, Size: 43)
[transcript:00:19:42] This is gonna whatever.
[transcript:00:19:46] Oh, there's a organ that looked decent that I want to play.
[transcript:00:19:51] What is that?
[transcript:00:19:51] One day I go to this.
[transcript:00:19:52] I'll pay the information.
[transcript:00:19:57] Chat, I don't want to cut flex for the chat.
[transcript:00:19:59] Not know anything, chat.

[transcript:00:20:02] I'm kind of like a responsible, oh, Loki.
[transcript:00:20:04] Yeah.
[keyframe:00:20:05] The video frame shows a YouTube video paused, displaying a night sky with clouds and a visible bright object, possibly the moon or a bright star, casting light. In the lower left corner, there is a smaller overlay of a person drinking from an orange mug, suggesting a live stream or video commentary setting. The environment appears casual and reflective, with a focus on celestial observation, creating a calm and relaxed atmosphere. (Cluster 49, Size: 66)
[transcript:00:20:12] For days, Israel's defenses have largely held up against Iran's missile attacks.
[transcript:00:20:17] But there's a growing concern that Israel is burning through its defensive weapons.
[transcript:00:20:23] And it's arrow interceptors which play a key role in taking out Iran's ballistic missiles.
[transcript:00:20:27] Can I have like infinite don't know?
[transcript:00:20:28] I, according to the US official.
[transcript:00:20:30] Not really, but play on new game,
[transcript:00:20:32] which is like a flash play.
[transcript:00:20:36] The US official and analysts familiar with the numbers say that Iran has more missiles
[transcript:00:20:41] than Israel and the US have interceptors raising concerns about it.
[transcript:00:20:46] Oh, no shot.
[transcript:00:20:47] Who said that?
[transcript:00:20:48] Israel is more.
[transcript:00:20:50] The US official and analysts familiar.
[transcript:00:20:52] Oh, that's Kappa.
[transcript:00:20:53] Oh, that's Kappa.
[transcript:00:20:54] With the numbers say that Iran has more.
[transcript:00:20:56] Chat, isn't that just gonna then baiting them to do it?
[transcript:00:20:58] I don't get it.
[transcript:00:20:58] That's odd.
[transcript:00:20:59] There's no shots.
[transcript:00:21:00] Or missiles than Israel and the US have interceptors raising concerns about
[keyframe:00:21:02] The video frame shows a woman in a white blouse speaking, likely presenting news or an informational segment, in an office setting with "The Wall Street Journal" signage in the background. A computer monitor behind her displays an image, contributing to the professional atmosphere. The frame also includes a smaller insert of a person in a casual setting, holding a drink, suggesting a relaxed, interactive element to the presentation. (Cluster 45, Size: 19)
[transcript:00:21:05] Israel's ability to defend itself long term.
[transcript:00:21:07] So here's what the interceptor shortfall means for Israel,
[transcript:00:21:10] it's allies and the broader Middle East.
[transcript:00:21:14] Israel uses different systems.
[transcript:00:21:16] Brother, brother, the United States have like, they spend like like a nine trillion,
[transcript:00:21:20] like earth, GDP's on fucking rocket and shit every year.
[transcript:00:21:25] They think that, oh, dude, this one country has more than all that.
[keyframe:00:21:26] The video frame shows a person seated in the lower left corner, appearing focused, possibly on a live stream or video call. The setting includes a wall with shelves and houseplants, creating a cozy home environment. The main visual elements are illustrated depictions of missile defense systems labeled "ARROW 3," "ARROW 2," "DAVID'S SLING," and "IRON DOME," giving the frame an informative and educational atmosphere. (Cluster 30, Size: 21)
[transcript:00:21:27] No shot.
[transcript:00:21:28] Come on, bro.
[transcript:00:21:29] Mumbra.
[transcript:00:21:30] of its airspace.
[transcript:00:21:31] The arrow three is considered the crown jewel of this network.
[transcript:00:21:35] With a range of about 1500 miles, the arrow three is used to counter long
[transcript:00:21:39] range ballistic missiles, including those that fly above the earth's atmosphere.
[transcript:00:21:44] Arrow three has been critical encountering attacks from Iran and Yemen
[transcript:00:21:47] and it can intercept threats before they cross into Israel's airspace.
[transcript:00:21:51] The arrow two, an older version of the system,
[keyframe:00:21:52] The video frame features a map showing a highlighted circular range over the Middle East, suggesting a focus on missile or flight trajectory. Inset in the lower-left corner, a person is visible, holding a cup, seemingly engaged in watching or discussing the content. The overall atmosphere is analytical and informative, with a modern, multimedia presentation style, indicated by the graphical elements and the Wall Street Journal logo. (Cluster 47, Size: 43)
[transcript:00:21:54] is also used to intercept short to medium range ballistic missiles.
[transcript:00:21:58] Then there's David Sling, primarily used to counter medium range ballistic
[transcript:00:22:02] missiles among other threats.
[transcript:00:22:03] Who's David?
[transcript:00:22:04] And finally, the Iron Dome, which is used to shoot down short range threats
[transcript:00:22:08] like rockets from Gaza.
[transcript:00:22:10] Experts say the Iron Dome is not playing a major role in this current conflict
[transcript:00:22:13] with Iran and that the arrow systems of its
[transcript:00:22:16] Sling have been key.
[transcript:00:22:18] David and Delaia have flipped through.
[transcript:00:22:21] Israel's layered defense has proven to be extremely effective.
[transcript:00:22:24] Israel says its interception rate for ballistic missiles is about 90 percent
[keyframe:00:22:26] The video frame features a split-screen format, with a woman on the left and footage of a dark sky with a bright object on the right. The woman, dressed in a professional outfit, is inside an office setting with "Wall Street" partially visible on a background wall, indicating a financial or news environment. The overall mood is serious and informative, as the woman appears to be delivering news or commentary while the night sky footage suggests an event or phenomenon being reported. (Cluster 0, Size: 17)
[transcript:00:22:28] and of the 370 missiles fired by Iran in response to about 30 have made an impact
[transcript:00:22:34] as of June 17th.
[transcript:00:22:35] But as Tom Caraggo, the director of the missile defense project at CSIS put it to me,
[transcript:00:22:40] the capability is not the question.
[transcript:00:22:42] It's the capacity that matters.
[transcript:00:22:45] And capacity could be a huge problem because arrows play a key role in shooting down
[transcript:00:22:50] not just Iran's ballistic missiles, but also threats from Iranian proxy groups
[transcript:00:22:55] like the Houthis in Yemen.
[transcript:00:22:56] In a statement, the Israeli defense forces said the IDF is
[transcript:00:23:00] put here at the end of the scenario.
[transcript:00:23:02] Unfortunately, we are unable to comment on matters related to munitions.
[transcript:00:23:06] Israel doesn't talk about how many interceptors it has because of its enemies
[transcript:00:23:10] knew that number.
[transcript:00:23:11] They would know how many missiles to fire at the country.
[transcript:00:23:16] The company that makes the arrow interceptors, IAI, did not respond to requests for comment.
[transcript:00:23:21] Back in December, Israel's defense ministry struck a deal with IAI to make more
[transcript:00:23:26] arrow three interceptors.
[transcript:00:23:27] However, the arrows are complex missiles that cost more than $2 million a piece
[transcript:00:23:32] and take time to produce.
[transcript:00:23:34] Analysts say in general, defensive weapons are harder and more expensive to make than offensive
[transcript:00:23:38] weapons because they have to be more sophisticated and more precise than the missiles they're designed
[transcript:00:23:43] to take out.
[transcript:00:23:44] I mean, that makes sense.
[transcript:00:23:46] I mean, yeah, that absolutely makes sense for sure.
[transcript:00:23:48] In some cases, you have to fire several interceptors in order to neutralize a missile.
[keyframe:00:23:51] The frame shows a night sky with scattered clouds and several bright lights, suggesting movement or possibly aerial activity above a cityscape. In the foreground, there are silhouettes of high-rise buildings, hinting at an urban environment. The mood appears tense or contemplative, emphasized by the dim lighting and the sole figure in the bottom-left corner, who seems to be observing or reacting to the scene outside. (Cluster 58, Size: 27)
[transcript:00:23:52] In what of you?
[transcript:00:23:55] That's why Israel has been focused on taking out Iran's missile and drone capabilities on the ground
[transcript:00:24:00] during its aerial campaign.
[transcript:00:24:03] The IDF says it has dismantled more than one-third of Iran's missile launchers.
[transcript:00:24:10] But Iran has still been able to launch volleys of missiles at Israel.
[keyframe:00:24:12] The video frame depicts a missile or rocket launch with bright flames and smoke billowing into the night sky, indicating a powerful ascent. The setting appears to be a remote location, as suggested by the label "Unknown Location, Iran," lending a sense of mystery and tension. The mood is intense and dramatic, with the fiery illumination contrasting against the darkness, creating a visually striking and dynamic scene. (Cluster 60, Size: 22)
[transcript:00:24:14] The United States, aware of Israel's interceptor capacity issues for months,
[transcript:00:24:18] has been augmenting the country's defenses.
[transcript:00:24:20] We are full of gratitude and thanks.
[transcript:00:24:22] Chad, what if they do the same thing they have with Iran?
[transcript:00:24:27] You know that the globe has like all of the fucking chat that is satellites in space or whatever.
[transcript:00:24:34] Dude, guys, let's go again.
[keyframe:00:24:34] The video frame features a split-screen with a news segment. On the right, a man in a suit is speaking against a backdrop of blue and white geometric patterns; he appears to be the main focus. On the left, another person is seated at a desk, likely watching the broadcast, with visible text overlay providing context about the news topic. The overall atmosphere is informative and serious, characteristic of a news broadcast. (Cluster 8, Size: 59)
[transcript:00:24:36] Mother of the Suck-in starlink.
[transcript:00:24:38] It's a starlink to same thing, right?
[transcript:00:24:41] But all the nodes have rockets.
[transcript:00:24:44] And then it serves as a global anti-rocket reach.
[transcript:00:24:49] And then there's some guys as your fuck this shit.
[transcript:00:24:51] I'm putting a rocket in space because they have to go to other places.
[transcript:00:24:55] They have to do a bubble stratosphere to hit those right.
[transcript:00:24:59] Boom, these guys bang.
[transcript:00:25:01] Should have down it.
[transcript:00:25:02] It's called the global globe.
[transcript:00:25:05] The offensive systems that the United States has put in play.
[transcript:00:25:08] There's the ground-based THAAD system which can intercept missiles inside or outside the atmosphere.
[transcript:00:25:13] And the US has sent Navy ships into the region which can counter missiles with SM2,
[transcript:00:25:17] SM3, and SM6 interceptors.
[transcript:00:25:20] Plus fighter jets can shoot down drones, missiles, and other threats.
[keyframe:00:25:23] The video frame features a graphic illustrating military assets, including an F-15E/F-16 fighter jet, a destroyer, and a THAAD system, each annotated with their respective ranges. The background is a simple map, emphasizing strategic locations with connecting lines. There's a technical and informative mood, enhanced by a clutter-free layout and subdued color palette, suggesting a focus on military strategy and technology. (Cluster 22, Size: 25)
[transcript:00:25:24] Oh, and I can say so they have a mobile anti-air.
[transcript:00:25:30] So even if they run out pretty much, they just pull up proxy.
[transcript:00:25:35] And I can say with authority that they have saved hundreds, perhaps thousands of lives over the past four days
[transcript:00:25:40] since Iran has been firing these ballistic missiles into our population centers.
[transcript:00:25:45] But US interceptors aren't unlimited either.
[transcript:00:25:47] For example, defense documents show that the US has only procured about 600 THAAD interceptors to date.
[transcript:00:25:54] Oh, this public document linking their threats says it only did this.
[transcript:00:26:01] Oh, dude.
[transcript:00:26:03] Ah, that's that's I believe this.
[keyframe:00:26:03] The video frame shows a spreadsheet or document on a computer screen, focusing on a section titled "Procurement Quantity" with a highlighted quantity of "605." In the bottom left corner, a person is visible, seemingly engaging with the content displayed. The setting appears to be a typical office or home workspace, with a subdued and analytical atmosphere, suggesting a focus on data review or presentation. (Cluster 57, Size: 14)
[transcript:00:26:06] The current conflict in the Middle East.
[transcript:00:26:07] What I look at first is quiet and say I was looking for a seesaw.
[keyframe:00:26:07] The frame shows a woman seated in a newsroom setting, with "The Wall Street Journal" prominently displayed on the wall behind her. She is wearing a white blouse and appears poised, possibly delivering news or commentary. A monitor beside her displays an image of a rocket launch, adding an element of dynamic energy to the otherwise calm environment, while a small inset in the lower-left corner shows another individual in a different setting. (Cluster 61, Size: 39)
[transcript:00:26:11] Remember, Iran cannot have any of the weapons very simple.
[keyframe:00:26:14] The video frame shows a man in a suit speaking animatedly, possibly in a serious tone, as a subtitle reads, "Remember, Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. It's very simple." The setting appears to be indoors, possibly an official or governmental environment, with a screen displaying a seal or emblem in the background. Inset at the bottom left, another person is casually seated, perhaps reacting or commenting, contributing to a dichotomy of formal and informal atmospheres. (Cluster 29, Size: 8)
[transcript:00:26:15] Analysts say that whatever happens, officials need to act fast to end the war
[transcript:00:26:18] because the US and Israel can't afford to sit and intercept missiles for an extended period of time.
[transcript:00:26:24] Dude, it was a glitch.
[transcript:00:26:26] They said the file redacted and then there was, you're missing three zeros.
[transcript:00:26:30] It's a common day glitch.
[transcript:00:26:32] It's is what it is.
[transcript:00:26:32] I'm like, what can I do about it?
[keyframe:00:26:34] The video frame shows a live stream featuring a host in the corner and chat interactions on the side. The main image depicts a damaged building, likely from a missile strike, with debris and structural damage visible. The atmosphere is tense and urgent, underscored by on-screen news graphics reporting the event. (Cluster 46, Size: 8)
[transcript:00:26:40] Um...
[transcript:00:26:41] Anyway.
[transcript:00:26:43] I'll put it on a few points.
[transcript:00:26:44] The gamble there.
[transcript:00:26:46] Not the gamble you think.

[transcript:00:28:14] So...
[transcript:00:28:17] Sure, please, yeah?
[transcript:00:28:25] Yeah, it's back-to-back knockout, exactly.
