[transcript:00:44:37] That's why it's called the typical worker.
[transcript:00:44:39] And I thought 20 times was a lot.
[transcript:00:44:41] Okay.
[transcript:00:44:42] Hold on and ask.
[transcript:00:44:43] Let me ask.
[transcript:00:44:44] But what about the size of their companies though?
[transcript:00:44:48] Do their companies now have more employees or not?
[transcript:00:44:52] I feel like hold on.
[transcript:00:44:53] We globalize it or whatever.
[transcript:00:44:54] These companies have now more employees.
[transcript:00:44:57] It's a bigger infrastructure.
[transcript:00:44:59] So the Pyramid, yes, is steep at the top, but it's larger at the bottom.
[keyframe:00:45:03] The video frame features a person in a white shirt standing in front of a large graph labeled "CEO PAY VS. TYPICAL WORKER," which shows a steep upward trend. The setting appears to be a presentation or commentary setup, possibly digital, as there is an overlay image of another person in the bottom left corner, seemingly captured live streaming with headphones. The visual style is informative with a focus on data presentation, creating a serious and analytical mood. (Cluster 12, Size: 50)
[transcript:00:45:06] So if you compare, yeah, the top of the bottom is bad, but it's a much larger Pyramid.
[transcript:00:45:12] Those at the top are receiving much larger shares of that growing economy.
[transcript:00:45:18] The nose at the middle or at the bottom of the wage distribution.
[transcript:00:45:21] So that pulling apart that increasing economic inequality is not a take it.
[keyframe:00:45:24] The main subject in the frame is a person with curly gray hair, wearing a black top, speaking or engaged in conversation, and appears to be in a home environment with light-colored walls and doors. In the corner, there is a smaller inset showing another person seated in a room with musical equipment, possibly listening or responding to the main subject. The atmosphere seems calm and focused, suggesting a virtual or remote interaction, possibly an interview or discussion. (Cluster 0, Size: 121)
[transcript:00:45:26] Is a parent?
[transcript:00:45:27] Bro, it's not.
[transcript:00:45:28] It's a Pyramid.
[transcript:00:45:29] Bro, if you have a three slice Pyramid, top the bottom is only three layers.
[transcript:00:45:36] Yeah, you're closer to the bottom.
[transcript:00:45:37] But if you're massive Pyramid, you're the fucking 60 slice.
[transcript:00:45:41] You got the top ones a lot more than the bottom.
[transcript:00:45:43] It's just the way it is, no?
[transcript:00:45:44] No matter how you look at it, that pie is going increasingly to the very top.
[transcript:00:45:50] Okay, okay.
[transcript:00:45:51] But isn't inequality often seen as a byproduct of rapid economic growth?
[keyframe:00:45:55] The video frame features a main subject, a man in a white shirt, standing prominently in an urban setting with tall buildings in the background and a digital, dynamic appearance. A floating digital display with information and smaller inset frames, possibly depicting additional scenes or related content, adds a modern, technological layer. The atmosphere is a mix of futuristic and analytic, with a focus on digital interaction and urban life. (Cluster 39, Size: 154)
[transcript:00:45:56] Could this be a good thing for our economy?
[transcript:00:45:59] Yes, people are getting really rich.
[transcript:00:46:00] It's inevitable.
[transcript:00:46:01] Because they're innovating and making our economy more productive.
[transcript:00:46:05] And plus, everything I've shown you is before taxes, guys.
[transcript:00:46:08] So like the rich pay a lot of taxes.
[transcript:00:46:10] Okay, so let's see what happens to the income of the rich people after taxes.
[transcript:00:46:14] Here we go.
[transcript:00:46:15] Oh, okay.
[transcript:00:46:21] Well, the taxes didn't do that much.
[transcript:00:46:26] There's something going on here.
[transcript:00:46:28] The rich are getting really rich, really fast.
[transcript:00:46:30] I mean, what these lines all show is that 1980 was kind of this inflection point in our
[transcript:00:46:37] economy, where the top earners kind of started to get in on most of the prosperity.
[transcript:00:46:42] Trickled down, is brain dead?
[transcript:00:46:44] Stomp, bowl, bowl, bowl.
[transcript:00:46:46] And yes, the economy is not bad for an economy, actually.
[transcript:00:46:50] Spurs growth and investment into the economy.
[transcript:00:46:53] And eventually that raises all the trickled down.
[transcript:00:46:56] And advocate, yo, trickled like a brain dead.
[transcript:00:46:59] One, and even in motion, you would think that people would have to make more money, spend
[transcript:00:47:03] more.
[transcript:00:47:04] Roll, people would sell their grandma not to spend money when they're not even a while
[transcript:00:47:08] there at the top.
[transcript:00:47:09] It's fucking weird.
[transcript:00:47:10] It's weird.
[transcript:00:47:10] It's at all the day.
[transcript:00:47:11] That's the way of thinking, say that we shouldn't focus on inequality, but instead
[transcript:00:47:14] on poverty reduction.
[transcript:00:47:16] Okay?
[transcript:00:47:16] But that's what happens.
[transcript:00:47:18] How are we dealing with poverty?
[transcript:00:47:19] How do you plummet it after World War II?
[transcript:00:47:21] But you can see that at this time, like 1980, when inequality starts to get really bad,
[transcript:00:47:27] poverty basically stays the same.
[transcript:00:47:30] Goes up for a big series of years.
[transcript:00:47:32] So this is concerning.
[transcript:00:47:34] And this is my interpretation of the data.
[transcript:00:47:37] I'm sure some of you have very different interpretations and I would love to see down
[transcript:00:47:41] in the comments.
[transcript:00:47:42] Anyway, let's check in on the American Dream.
[transcript:00:47:44] America's all about.
[transcript:00:47:45] Miami problem, I'm not a people that are rich making too much money.
[transcript:00:47:48] The problem is that they don't spend enough.
[transcript:00:47:50] This will sound like a dump take.
[transcript:00:47:52] I have more of a problem that people not spending money than then making more money.
[transcript:00:47:57] I have a problem with them making a lot of money.
[transcript:00:47:59] You do that, you do this or whatever.
[transcript:00:48:00] You get into the system, you make money is what it is.
[transcript:00:48:03] How about you fucking spend it before you die?
[transcript:00:48:06] There's no life 2.0 waste your money.
[keyframe:00:48:06] The video frame features three individuals prominently placed in the foreground against a suburban residential backdrop. One person in the front looks directly ahead, while the other two, a man and a woman, stand closely together in a relaxed pose. The setting appears to be in a neighborhood, creating a casual and somewhat reflective atmosphere, enhanced by warm, muted lighting and a comfortable home environment. (Cluster 29, Size: 39)
[transcript:00:48:09] It's what it's meant to do to you.
[transcript:00:48:12] Just go and fucking just blow it up.
[transcript:00:48:15] A big risk, big reward.
[transcript:00:48:17] So yeah, inequality is happening.
[transcript:00:48:19] But like if you can go from rags to riches,
[transcript:00:48:22] maybe that's very American and okay.
[transcript:00:48:24] First born in 1970s, I'm now an adult in the name.
[transcript:00:48:27] The children that we don't care, we don't care.
[transcript:00:48:29] You went, you were out of spot, you got to some place, I don't give a shit.
[transcript:00:48:33] You're gonna work for your money.
[transcript:00:48:34] I don't give a fuck.
[transcript:00:48:35] I'm like, you don't get a free pass to the fucking top, you fucking loser.
[transcript:00:48:38] And then you have any children and fucking spawning at the fucking top layer.
[transcript:00:48:41] I'll give a shit fucking bitch ass.
[transcript:00:48:43] Yo, get into the cold mind, start fucking diggin loser fuck.
[transcript:00:48:46] What is on this guy?
[transcript:00:48:47] And the data says that 59% of us born to the middle income
[transcript:00:48:50] will out earn our parents.
[transcript:00:48:52] So that means that 40% of my peers here in the middle income
[transcript:00:48:57] will earn the same or less than their parents.
[transcript:00:48:59] Yo, I will do an Easter egg hunt full of money with all my fuck,
[transcript:00:49:04] with my lifetime earning it before I give that shit to my children.
[keyframe:00:49:04] The video frame is a digital illustration featuring two groups labeled "Middle Income Earners" with people standing under this label. On the left, a group is labeled "1970s with one man, four dependents," while the right group is labeled "2020s." A modern setting in the background includes a building with lit windows. The illustration has a slightly muted color palette, creating an informative and analytical atmosphere. (Cluster 37, Size: 16)
[transcript:00:49:06] Are you kidding me?
[transcript:00:49:08] What a joke.
[transcript:00:49:08] Even as we are seeing all of this economic growth.
[transcript:00:49:12] I mean, you can see this trend here.
[transcript:00:49:14] The American dream of being able to move up the ladder
[transcript:00:49:16] is becoming less and less a reality for a bigger and bigger portion of the population.
[keyframe:00:49:17] The frame features a person on the right, likely explaining a graph displayed prominently in the background. The graph shows a downward trend labeled "Likelihood of Earning More Than Parents" for individuals born into median income families. There is an inset of another person in a smaller window at the bottom left, possibly indicating a video call or dual presentation. The setting suggests an informative or educational context, with a focused and analytical mood. (Cluster 32, Size: 83)
[transcript:00:49:23] Okay, so that was a big change from all the trends.
[transcript:00:49:26] Yeah.
[transcript:00:49:27] Let's see what happens next.
[transcript:00:49:29] People assume the time is a strict program,
[transcript:00:49:32] of course, to effect, but actually it's more like a big bowl of wibi wibi,
[transcript:00:49:36] timey whimy stuff.
[transcript:00:49:38] Okay, we're moving into the new millennium.
[transcript:00:49:39] America's fighting a couple of wars.
[keyframe:00:49:39] The video frame features a man standing in an open urban area with large electronic billboards displaying various images, including a graph and colorful visuals. The setting appears to be a bustling cityscape with a digital and modernized atmosphere, suggesting a technologically-driven environment. The mood is dynamic and slightly chaotic, highlighted by the contrasting elements of digital screens and the presence of a small inset showing another person in an indoor space, adding layers to the scene. (Cluster 38, Size: 76)
[transcript:00:49:41] The economy's actually doing pretty well until whoops.
[transcript:00:49:44] Whoa.
[transcript:00:49:45] The banker's got a little Lucy Goosey for a couple of years,
[transcript:00:49:47] making it seen amounts of money and crashing the entire world economy.
[transcript:00:49:50] But okay, we'll prove on from the biggest recession of our time.
[transcript:00:49:54] We're arriving in 2010s.
[transcript:00:49:56] This is a world that most of us are familiar with.
[transcript:00:49:59] Let's see how the median income earner fares.
[transcript:00:50:02] Yeah, it gets pretty bad here, I think.
[transcript:00:50:04] All of those jobs have dried up and been shipped to Asia.
[transcript:00:50:07] So I now work as a middle manager at an insurance company,
[transcript:00:50:09] and my household income is $81,000 a year,
[transcript:00:50:13] which is, wait a minute, same as 1997,
[transcript:00:50:15] but wait, during this same 13 year period from 1997 to 2010,
[transcript:00:50:19] the economy grew by this much.
[transcript:00:50:22] I mean, I just want to see what is the woman at work ratio is also.
[transcript:00:50:26] Because now, now I'm thinking,
[transcript:00:50:28] they put a lot more women at work,
[transcript:00:50:30] yet the housing income is the same.
[transcript:00:50:33] Line's going up.
[transcript:00:50:34] The economy's making more stuff,
[transcript:00:50:35] there's more prosperity.
[transcript:00:50:37] Even when you adjust for inflation per capita,
[transcript:00:50:39] the economy grew.
[transcript:00:50:40] There should be more to go around.
[transcript:00:50:42] But my household pay is the same as it was 13 years previous.
[transcript:00:50:47] Why?
[transcript:00:50:48] Well, we'll see in a second.
[transcript:00:50:49] But first, let's talk about my house.
[transcript:00:50:51] I always love talking about my house.
[transcript:00:50:53] Look at this beauty.
[transcript:00:50:54] I can still afford a house.
[transcript:00:50:56] In fact, here in like post recession America,
[transcript:00:51:00] housing prices are actually pretty low.
[transcript:00:51:03] The bubble burst, interest rates had to go down
[transcript:00:51:06] to stimulate the economy.
[transcript:00:51:08] And so home purchasing was actually pretty accessible
[transcript:00:51:10] for a few years.
[transcript:00:51:12] But don't worry, housing prices will be back on the rise
[transcript:00:51:14] in a second.
[transcript:00:51:15] And in fact, they'll start rising faster than my income,
[transcript:00:51:19] making housing less and less affordable.
[transcript:00:51:21] And homeownership still seems to be available mostly
[transcript:00:51:24] for certain groups and not as much for others.
[transcript:00:51:28] In fact, that hasn't changed much since the segregation days.
[transcript:00:51:31] Meanwhile, I think I know what's going to happen to this graph.
[keyframe:00:51:33] The video frame features two main subjects: a person in the foreground pointing at a line graph labeled "Family Income Growth by Group" and another person in a smaller video inset at the bottom left, possibly reacting or interacting with the content. The setting appears to be a presentation or commentary environment, with a plain blue background enhancing the focus on the graph and subjects. The key visual elements include the graph's colored lines and the subjects' engaged expressions, creating an informative and analytical atmosphere. (Cluster 59, Size: 64)
[transcript:00:51:34] What if all the residents of a certain village or like neighborhood
[transcript:00:51:38] make a co-op, everybody puts money to a pot, right?
[transcript:00:51:42] And we buy all the houses, we get bigger loans,
[transcript:00:51:45] we're a bigger group, and we do crowd-funded house sorting.
[transcript:00:51:51] Yep.
[transcript:00:51:52] But the richer just getting richer faster than my income
[transcript:00:51:55] is going up.
[transcript:00:51:56] And my income's kind of stagnating.
[transcript:00:51:58] OK, what about the CEOs?
[transcript:00:52:00] They pay a price for the big bubble person.
[transcript:00:52:02] Nope.
[transcript:00:52:03] I mean, they kind of did up and down.
[transcript:00:52:04] But they're still, by the end of the decade,
[transcript:00:52:06] getting paid hundreds of times more than me.
[transcript:00:52:09] It's not a call, rag.
[transcript:00:52:10] They are hundreds of times more productive,
[transcript:00:52:12] and they deserve it.
[transcript:00:52:14] No, no, no.
[transcript:00:52:14] I'm talking about we buy houses or sell them.
[transcript:00:52:19] And then you do a bunch of gunshots,
[transcript:00:52:21] and never heard of it, right?
[transcript:00:52:22] Or whatever.
[transcript:00:52:22] You increase crime artificially, like fake crimes, whatever.
[transcript:00:52:26] The price of the houses go down, you buy them back, right?
[keyframe:00:52:27] The video frame features a split-screen with a person seated in a room on the bottom left, appearing to be engaged in a discussion or presentation. The main focus is a graph labeled "Productivity vs Wages" displayed prominently, showing two lines with productivity rising higher than wages over time in the main section of the screen. The setting suggests an informative or educational context, with a neutral mood highlighted by the analytical nature of the graph and the person's engaged posture. (Cluster 8, Size: 26)
[transcript:00:52:30] No more crime, all of a sudden, because you're
[transcript:00:52:31] you start the guys stuff, and stuff to fake crime.
[transcript:00:52:34] And then you sell them again.
[transcript:00:52:37] Holy shit.
[transcript:00:52:38] I mean, Jack, that is insane.
[transcript:00:52:40] This is what we've been hearing about for a long time.
[transcript:00:52:42] All of these graphs have the same shape,
[transcript:00:52:45] this great divergence that happens in the 80s,
[transcript:00:52:48] where the economy is growing.
[transcript:00:52:50] But the wages for the average person just kind of flattened
[transcript:00:52:54] while the top earners just sort of get in on all.
[transcript:00:52:57] Yeah, that's fraud.
[keyframe:00:52:57] The video frame features a graph titled "Income After Tax," depicting income trends for different groups. The graph shows lines for the "Top 1%," "Middle 40%," and "Bottom 50%" from 1950 to 2010, highlighting a significant income rise for the top 1%. In the bottom-left corner, a person is visible in a home or office setting, creating an informational and analytical atmosphere. (Cluster 52, Size: 37)
[transcript:00:52:58] So what?
[transcript:00:52:58] What about fraud?
[transcript:00:52:59] If the top 1% all do fraud, why can't the bottom do it?
[transcript:00:53:03] They can do fraud?
[transcript:00:53:04] OK, fraud too.
[transcript:00:53:05] OK, fuck it.
[transcript:00:53:06] It's a disparity.
[transcript:00:53:06] OK, but the American dream.
[transcript:00:53:07] No, equalized fraud.
[transcript:00:53:09] I'm not a writer, right?
[transcript:00:53:10] So if you're born in the 1980s, which I was,
[transcript:00:53:13] you're now an adult in the 2010s, and it looks like,
[transcript:00:53:17] for the median earner, the majority of us
[transcript:00:53:20] will earn the same or less than our parents.
[transcript:00:53:23] Yeah, this is a problem, and probably
[transcript:00:53:26] doesn't seem fair to a lot of people.
[transcript:00:53:28] But wait, there's hope.
[transcript:00:53:29] Star Trek, Terminator, Time Cop, Time Afterton,
[transcript:00:53:32] Quantum 8, Rinkling Time, Somewhere, and Time.
[transcript:00:53:34] Time machine.
[transcript:00:53:35] Time machine.
[transcript:00:53:36] OK, I'm back.
[transcript:00:53:38] 2025.
[transcript:00:53:39] That's when I'm making this video.
[transcript:00:53:41] So that's modern day for me.
[transcript:00:53:42] We went through a pandemic.
[transcript:00:53:43] The economy kind of got freaked out for a little bit.
[transcript:00:53:45] And the median income earner actually
[transcript:00:53:48] started to see some gains after years and years
[transcript:00:53:51] of flatlining.
[transcript:00:53:52] So you do see some potential movement here, some hope.
[transcript:00:53:56] But let's get back to the original question
[keyframe:00:53:56] The video frame features a man in a white shirt speaking, likely explaining the chart displayed behind him. The chart shows a rising trend labeled "Real GDP per Capita," indicating economic growth. The setting is simple and professional, with a muted blue background, conveying an informative and analytical mood. (Cluster 10, Size: 128)
[transcript:00:53:57] that we started this video with.
[keyframe:00:53:58] The frame features a person in the foreground, positioned in a warmly lit, indoor environment with maps and notes visible on a board in the background. The setting appears to be a study or an office, characterized by a cozy and focused atmosphere. A small inset shows another view of a person speaking, suggesting a video presentation or commentary. (Cluster 27, Size: 145)
[transcript:00:53:59] Is the average?
[transcript:00:54:00] Quick, I would comment, Jack, because I
[transcript:00:54:02] feel like if you rob a store, OK, for like $5,000,
[transcript:00:54:06] you get clapped mega jail, or maybe second offense,
[transcript:00:54:09] you get mega jail.
[transcript:00:54:11] How come you don't get clapped that hard
[transcript:00:54:13] when you don't pay your tax on your fraudulent thing?
[transcript:00:54:15] You get $5,000.
[transcript:00:54:18] And your back, your back, things like,
[transcript:00:54:20] fucking three years, and you're skimming the government,
[transcript:00:54:22] and they get you.
[transcript:00:54:23] OK, you get 44 years in jail.
[keyframe:00:54:25] The video frame features a man speaking directly to the camera, gesturing with his hands, suggesting he is explaining or discussing something. The setting appears to be a cozy, warmly lit room with a plant, wall art, and photographs pinned on a board in the background, giving it a personal and informal atmosphere. A smaller inset shows a man holding a camera, indicating a behind-the-scenes perspective, enhancing the overall engaging and conversational mood. (Cluster 6, Size: 86)
[transcript:00:54:26] That's it.
[transcript:00:54:27] Oh, oh, you didn't want to go to jail.
[transcript:00:54:30] Oh, I'm about it.
[transcript:00:54:30] Then don't do fraudulent.
[transcript:00:54:32] It's that simple.
[transcript:00:54:35] American better off now than they were back in the 50s
[transcript:00:54:39] and over these decades.
[transcript:00:54:40] That's the problem.
[transcript:00:54:40] 
[transcript:00:54:41] And a lot of ways, the answer is yes,
[transcript:00:54:44] especially if you are a woman or not white,
[transcript:00:54:47] then the answer is yes, in at least in terms of economic opportunity.
[transcript:00:54:51] But what we've seen on this journey
[transcript:00:54:52] is that the American economy has produced
[transcript:00:54:55] an incredible amount of prosperity and growth
[transcript:00:54:58] over these last seven decades.
[transcript:00:54:59] And that was shared broadly by all of us for a time.
[transcript:00:55:05] But in the last 30, 40 years, the data is very clear
[transcript:00:55:08] that the fruits of the economic growth these days
[transcript:00:55:12] have not been broadly shared.
[transcript:00:55:14] One group is collecting most of the growth.
[transcript:00:55:18] And I didn't even talk about wealth,
[transcript:00:55:20] like the stuff you just own and how that makes sense.
[transcript:00:55:22] OK, is this a little bit like a zero sum?
[transcript:00:55:26] We're talking just about income on this.
[transcript:00:55:28] Now, this isn't the first time that we've been in the situation.
[transcript:00:55:32] The top 10% collected almost half of all the income
[transcript:00:55:35] way back in the early 1900s before World War II.
[transcript:00:55:38] But we changed that.
[transcript:00:55:40] Well, I'm a dumb man.
[transcript:00:55:43] And the income starts to be distributed.
[transcript:00:55:45] What?
[transcript:00:55:46] This talking point is like if these guys didn't make that amount of money
[transcript:00:55:52] or whatever that amount would go to the bottom,
[transcript:00:55:55] their money should be hours.
[transcript:00:55:58] That's not how that works, is it?
[transcript:00:56:00] More equally.
[transcript:00:56:01] But this graph tells the same story looked 1980.
[keyframe:00:56:02] The video frame features two individuals engaged in a discussion. The setting appears to be informal, possibly a room with one person seated on the left wearing headphones in front of a computer, and another person on the right gesturing towards a large graph projected or displayed prominently in the background. The graph shows data related to income inequality in the U.S., with lines indicating trends over time, creating an informative and analytical atmosphere focused on economic discourse. (Cluster 44, Size: 43)
[transcript:00:56:04] Boom, here it goes.
[transcript:00:56:05] We're back.
[transcript:00:56:06] We're back to where we were.
[transcript:00:56:09] Oh, now does this mean that our economy is broken?
[transcript:00:56:12] No, actually.
[transcript:00:56:13] Our economy is not broken.
[transcript:00:56:15] It is working exactly how it was designed to work.
[transcript:00:56:18] And this and this and this and this.
[transcript:00:56:21] It's the result of changes to the rules.
[transcript:00:56:24] Policies that end up determining who gets the money and who doesn't.
[transcript:00:56:28] These policies are made by people that we elect.
[transcript:00:56:31] And if we don't think that this is fair,
[transcript:00:56:33] we have the power to pressure them to design a system that is fair.
[transcript:00:56:39] Now, the medium income earner doesn't have newly as much power these.
[transcript:00:56:43] So what about a dynamic minimum wage based on how successful a company is?
[transcript:00:56:49] And it goes up and down dynamically with the state of everything.
[transcript:00:56:54] Days, the top income earners and the corporations have really gotten their foot in the door
[transcript:00:56:59] for the people who have the power to set the rules.
[transcript:00:57:02] So it's harder than ever, but this still is a democracy.
[transcript:00:57:04] Oh, that's the bad idea.
[transcript:00:57:05] The system is fair.
[transcript:00:57:06] How many times has it been?
[transcript:00:57:07] OK, OK, then I'll do it.
[transcript:00:57:09] Then I'll do it like we're doing in these days.
[transcript:00:57:10] And the more money we make, the less I give a shit by everybody.
[transcript:00:57:14] And you guys get fucked up even harder.
[transcript:00:57:17] And I'm making more money.
[transcript:00:57:19] I'm saying I want you to fucking even harder as much as I can actually.
[transcript:00:57:22] We still have now.
[transcript:00:57:24] Now we're here now.
[transcript:00:57:24] We're not sure our politicians to change it.
[transcript:00:57:27] And it's not actually just about income inequality.
[transcript:00:57:29] Yes, that has risen.
[transcript:00:57:31] The rich get richer much faster.
[transcript:00:57:33] It's also about the American dream.
[keyframe:00:57:33] The video frame depicts a woman hanging laundry to dry in a backyard, surrounded by suburban houses and a clear sky, suggesting a mid-20th century setting. She is focused on her task, with laundry strewn in a basket at her feet, adding a sense of daily routine. The black-and-white coloring, combined with the simplicity of the scene, creates a nostalgic and serene atmosphere. (Cluster 56, Size: 54)
[transcript:00:57:34] This idea of being able to move up.
[transcript:00:57:37] If you get educated, if you work hard, as inequality has gone up,
[transcript:00:57:41] the American dream has gone down.
[transcript:00:57:45] These graphs are built on robust data.
[transcript:00:57:48] And this is the story that it tells.
[transcript:00:57:50] The rungs of the economic ladder have gotten wider and wider apart.
[transcript:00:57:55] And that American dream, ironically a term coined by a rich
[transcript:00:57:59] investment banker born into a rich family in New York City.
[transcript:00:58:03] That dream is looking more and more like a myth.
[transcript:00:58:16] Banks are trash.
[transcript:00:58:18] Everybody's trash.
[transcript:00:58:19] Whole system sucks.
[transcript:00:58:21] I don't give a shit.
[transcript:00:58:23] That's my day.
[transcript:00:58:23] There's a chart.
[transcript:00:58:31] Ciao.
[transcript:00:58:32] We need a server reset there.
[transcript:00:58:33] I have a table over of our social.
[transcript:00:58:35] We are server wide reset.
[transcript:00:58:38] Dude, how is it that hard?
[transcript:00:58:41] Re-set the server.
[transcript:00:58:42] Brother, oops, we pulled the plug.
[transcript:00:58:44] The data has been wiped fucking globally across what we missed.
[transcript:00:58:47] A Mr robot plot fucking four reset.
[transcript:00:58:51] And everybody's now fucking broke.
[transcript:00:58:54] Boom done.
[transcript:00:58:55] Too easy.
[transcript:00:58:56] Too easy.
[transcript:00:58:56] Boom.
[keyframe:00:59:00] The video frame shows a person seated indoors, appearing to be in a casual environment, possibly a room or an office, suggested by visible shelves and furniture in the background. The main video content seems paused or not visible, with a blurred image featuring red text thatâ€™s difficult to read, set against a light background. The overall mood appears relaxed, as the person gazes at the screen calmly, and the YouTube interface indicates a typical browsing setup. (Cluster 45, Size: 40)
[transcript:00:59:02] Um.
[transcript:00:59:04] Check this out.
[transcript:00:59:05] It's a there.
[transcript:00:59:05] I clicked a little bit.
[transcript:00:59:06] I missed it.
[transcript:00:59:07] I had to open it.
[transcript:00:59:07] I helped in the video.
[transcript:00:59:11] No way, little BRO has your domain.
[keyframe:00:59:12] The video frame shows a computer screen displaying a YouTube homepage, with various thumbnails of different videos. The main subjects are the thumbnails; the prominent ones include images and text about current events, gaming, and music. The setting is an indoor environment, possibly a home office, with a visible presence of a person in the bottom left corner, wearing headphones and sitting in front of the screen. The overall mood is casual, typical of a person browsing content online. (Cluster 18, Size: 40)
[transcript:00:59:15] Is it you two video?
[transcript:00:59:16] I clicked on it earlier.
[transcript:00:59:17] I, I, I, I.
[transcript:00:59:19] No, not this.
[transcript:00:59:20] No, no.
[transcript:00:59:22] No.
[transcript:00:59:22] This one.
[transcript:00:59:23] It's a little interesting.
[transcript:00:59:28] Check the new alert.
[transcript:00:59:34] If you, if you haven't seen it.
[transcript:00:59:36] This 12, 26, 26, 26.
[transcript:00:59:38] How is he still alive?
[transcript:00:59:41] It was a two-year mids ago.
[transcript:00:59:43] Well, this guy, this guy, this guy's, guys, you guys can imagine about my six-year-old.
[transcript:00:59:47] Look at this guy.
[transcript:00:59:48] This guy's in the north.
[transcript:00:59:49] The military air lift is underway.
[transcript:00:59:51] On June 16th, at least 32 tanker aircraft departed from American bases toward Europe, landing
[transcript:00:59:59] at key stopover bases for Middle East operations.
[transcript:01:00:03] The mission remains on.
