[transcript:00:32:11] Oh look we're arriving to the 1950s
[transcript:00:32:16] Chat chat in order to make a video like this one should have this standardized the economy
[transcript:00:32:20] Like you would have to make the dollar amount work the amount the same to the entire video
[transcript:00:32:24] To account for inflation or whatever it was it doesn't make any sense
[transcript:00:32:27] So it's the 1950s in America
[transcript:00:32:29] And I the middle income earner have just returned from fighting in the most devastating more of human history
[keyframe:00:32:30] The video frame features a man in a military uniform standing in front of a suburban house, with mountains in the background. Another person is seated indoors, seen through a smaller window or screen overlay in the lower left corner. The juxtaposition of the nostalgic suburban scene with the muted colors and a hint of digital collage creates a surreal and slightly whimsical atmosphere.
[transcript:00:32:35] But we Americans came out on top and our economy is booming
[transcript:00:32:39] I work in this car factory
[transcript:00:32:41] It's one of the many factories that was converted from making weapons to now making valuable stuff that we're shipping around the world
[transcript:00:32:47] Our country is getting rich. I am making an average income. So my income right now is
[transcript:00:32:52] $4,400 in today's money. That's more like $41,000
[transcript:00:32:57] We're going to adjust everything for modern dollars in this case 2023 dollars prices are higher these days
[keyframe:00:33:00] The video frame features two main subjects: a man in a white shirt animatedly speaking in the foreground, and another man dressed in 1950s attire, including a beret, standing beside a shopping cart in the background. The environment appears to be a supermarket aisle, with shelves stocked with products forming a blurred backdrop. Key visual elements include a pop-up graphic displaying "1950's" with income details and traits, creating a nostalgic and informative atmosphere that contrasts past and present contexts.
[transcript:00:33:03] So our money is more valuable to make it all make sense
[transcript:00:33:05] Hey wait pause. I'm not gonna do that every single time like talk about the inflation
[transcript:00:33:09] I'm just gonna say everything from now on in modern dollars
[transcript:00:33:12] It'll allow us to compare a lot easier between the decades. Okay, with that. Let's get all the magic going again
[transcript:00:33:18] Pretty cool, right? Let's meet my family. So my wife doesn't work only a third of what I did
[transcript:00:33:24] I will say I will say because of all the laws in any I would assume that even though the lives are overall kind of worse, right?
[keyframe:00:33:30] The video frame depicts a person sitting indoors, looking at a screen, with another smaller inset of the same person, possibly streaming or recording. In the background, there's an illustration of a well-dressed couple from mid-20th century America, standing in front of a house with mountains and trees, conveying a nostalgic suburban setting. The mood is a mix of concentration due to the person's focus on the screen and a nostalgic atmosphere from the vintage imagery.
[transcript:00:33:31] All the programs are overall better if you're a fuck to not that fucked
[transcript:00:33:36] Competible for then and really she doesn't need to my factory job
[transcript:00:33:40] Supports the whole family and look I own that home. I paid $84,000 for this thing again in modern dollars
[transcript:00:33:47] That's actually not that much more than my yearly salary
[transcript:00:33:50] This is considered very affordable and a major reason why is because the government is helping me pay for a lot of this
[transcript:00:33:56] And they've got the cash to do it two year salary for a house. I mean look at the top tax rate for the rich
[keyframe:00:34:00] The video frame features a man in a white shirt positioned in front of a large graphic displaying a chart titled "HIGHEST MARGINAL INCOME TAX RATE." The setting appears to be a studio or office environment, visible in a smaller inset window in the bottom left corner, showing another person at a desk, likely engaged in streaming or video production. The mood is analytical and informative, with a focus on discussing historical tax rates.
[transcript:00:34:04] So a booming economy and all this tax revenue means that the government is helping build all of these suburban homes
[transcript:00:34:10] And is giving us veterans good to use the mortgages so that we can get in on the prospering US economy start building wealth by owning a home
[transcript:00:34:19] Our returning service man who was starting his own business would get a financial boost from the government
[transcript:00:34:25] A money would be advanced to buy property or a home. We're coming out of World War II
[transcript:00:34:30] There are absolutely lots of public programs policy makers today and back then had a lot to do with if I was presenting
[keyframe:00:34:30] The video frame features a person with curly gray hair wearing a black top, positioned centrally and facing the camera, possibly during a virtual discussion or interview. The setting appears to be a home environment with a mix of white and beige walls, a wooden door, and a glimpse of a living area with a red sofa. The mood is calm and focused, enhanced by the soft lighting, while an inset in the corner shows another individual speaking in what seems to be a virtual meeting interface.
[transcript:00:34:37] I would do chat I would I would have a tax for brackets of income also a tax for age
[transcript:00:34:44] You get a tax ratio differential from the other bracket
[transcript:00:34:50] To your age it's when you're younger you get tax less
[transcript:00:34:53] So you can expand your business expand your plans to further heights
[transcript:00:34:56] So the young get fucked on when you're younger how typical workers and their families were doing
[keyframe:00:35:00] The video frame shows a person with curly gray hair wearing a black shirt, standing indoors. The setting appears to be a cozy room with a door on one side and a red sofa partially visible. The atmosphere seems calm and neutral, with a smaller inset image in the corner showing another person in a different setting, possibly engaged in a conversation or video call.
[transcript:00:35:02] Okay, so the economy is booming. Let's see how all of this prosperity is being shared and for that
[transcript:00:35:06] I'm going to show you this amazing graph. I love this graph
[transcript:00:35:10] We're going to see it over the decades and it tells a very useful story
[transcript:00:35:15] This is my income the median earner here's the income of the top earners and this line is the low income in America and down here
[transcript:00:35:22] like
[transcript:00:35:24] Years okay watch what happens ready go
[transcript:00:35:30] Look at this happening all three of these income brackets are increasing their income at the same rate
[keyframe:00:35:30] The video frame features a line graph depicting wage trends from 1930 to 2010, highlighting three categories: top earners, median earners, and low earners. The graph shows the changes in income as a percentage of 1973 levels. In the bottom left corner, a person is visible, possibly streaming or commenting, adding a modern, analytical atmosphere to the scene.
[transcript:00:35:37] We are all getting in on this prosperity. We are sharing the spoils of a boom like why was it first?
[transcript:00:35:43] Then the roughly two three decades
[transcript:00:35:45] After World War II we saw what I would consider broadly shared prosperity as the economy grew as workers became more productive
[transcript:00:35:53] Workers across the board were actually seeing
[transcript:00:35:56] gains in their living standards. This is a great indicator that income equality in the United States is good and healthy
[keyframe:00:36:00] The video frame features a man in a white shirt gesturing as if explaining content presented on a screen behind him, including a graph titled "INEQUALITY GROWTH BY GROUP." Another inset image appears to show a historical comparison, with a smaller image of a man styled to represent the 1950s, accompanied by a text overlay about income, housing, and equality. The setting is a mix of modern infographic visuals and a casual, informative atmosphere, suggesting an educational or commentary tone.
[transcript:00:36:01] Oh, it's the rate amount last thing for the 1950s. Let's check in on the American dream
[transcript:00:36:05] Oh grow again. I move up the ladder. There's a really nice data set for this that says that I am nearly
[transcript:00:36:11] 100% likely to earn more than my parents. There is upward motion in the economy
[transcript:00:36:16] The American dream is alive at least for me, which is an important caveat here
[transcript:00:36:21] Women were mostly left out of the second-omic version of the American dream and so are people who weren't white like black Americans
[transcript:00:36:27] 10% of the population over a million of whom fought in the war
[keyframe:00:36:30] The video frame depicts a group of people standing closely together, with a focus on a young child wearing a white bow and dress. The environment appears to be outdoor or public, possibly an event or gathering, suggested by the varied attire of the adults around her. The muted color palette and soft focus give the scene a nostalgic and historical feel, enhancing a contemplative and somber atmosphere.
[transcript:00:36:31] But upon returning were met with these custom maps that were drawn to determine where they could and could not buy homes
[transcript:00:36:38] They were largely left out of all of this government help that allowed me chat
[transcript:00:36:41] You're like this and making money. If my business should be it might be in should be about 40%
[transcript:00:36:45] I was meant my business is 40% because
[transcript:00:36:47] 50% would mean same amount sent a amount of thing which would kind of be equalized
[transcript:00:36:52] But getting getting children usually I mean as a young man it kind of puts stop to your growth as a adult was the honest
[transcript:00:37:00] And hard to raise children properly and have a good job
[keyframe:00:37:00] The video frame features a person in the lower left corner, seemingly focused on a screen, likely reacting to or discussing the content displayed. The main visual element is a title from an article discussing the denial of the GI Bill's promise to Black WWII veterans, with portions highlighted in yellow for emphasis. The atmosphere appears analytical or critical, inviting reflection on historical inequality.
[transcript:00:37:03] So people that have children probably a little bit less at 40% I would say like an yes, no to get education and buy a home and build wealth
[transcript:00:37:10] But if you're just looking at the numbers the 1950s was a really good time for the median income earner
[transcript:00:37:15] You could have a family work in a factory and be loaded with opportunities to move up the economic ladder
[transcript:00:37:21] Thanks to a booming economy and a bunch of government programs. So now let's move forward in time to the 1970s
[keyframe:00:37:30] The video frame depicts an urban street scene with several buildings, including a diner and a shop, set against a backdrop of a city skyline. A person is prominently featured in the foreground, appearing to walk or stand on the street. A graph is overlaid in the upper right corner, adding an analytical element, while the atmosphere blends elements of bustling city life with a touch of analysis.
[transcript:00:37:33] Welcome to the 1970s
[transcript:00:37:34] This is the ascent in the smart guy. The economy is producing a lot more prosperity to go around as you can see by this graph
[transcript:00:37:41] And we'll see how that's all being distributed in a second
[transcript:00:37:43] But first let's check in on my pay. I'm still working in a factory. I now earn about 66,000
[transcript:00:37:49] If everybody's doing cocaine and you're doing cocaine, you're being doing less. So honestly, just do cocaine look at us
[transcript:00:37:54] That's what I say for the people that that means we I mean like millions of other women
[transcript:00:37:58] My wife has entered the workforce. They still only earn 60% of what men do
[keyframe:00:38:00] The video frame features two animated characters standing in front of a retro orange car, set in a suburban environment with a house visible in the background. The characters are stylishly dressed, with the male character in a blue sweater and the female character in a floral top, both appearing relaxed and confident. In the corner, there's a smaller live-action inset of a person at a computer, adding a contemporary and interactive element to the nostalgic and stylized atmosphere.
[transcript:00:38:03] But look they're breaking into the workforce nearly half of all women are going to be working by the end of the decade
[transcript:00:38:09] Partly as a push for freedom and economic autonomy, but partly as a necessity
[transcript:00:38:13] It's becoming harder for a family to be supported by a single earner
[transcript:00:38:17] The result is that our income is better off than it was in the 50s
[transcript:00:38:20] But things are also kind of expensive right now inflation is up
[transcript:00:38:24] Partly because there's war in the Middle East and they're cutting us off oil
[transcript:00:38:28] So there's long lines at these gas stations and everything is more expensive
[keyframe:00:38:30] The video frame shows a vintage scene with a red Volkswagen van traveling on a road lined with classic cars, set against a backdrop of palm trees and overcast skies, hinting at a potentially tropical or suburban area. The grainy, monochrome aesthetic suggests an old film or nostalgic effect, enhancing the retro vibe of the scene. In the bottom left, there is an inset of a person in a modern indoor setting, likely reacting to or narrating the video, creating a contrast between the past and present.
[transcript:00:38:31] Anyway, check out my house. I had to pay 230,000 dollars for this house
[transcript:00:38:36] Housing is getting more expensive and the government is raising the interest. Okay, well that said that's double
[transcript:00:38:41] Now we're talking it we went from two years out of the for a house with pretax about whatever
[transcript:00:38:45] Um to four times this is about four times three to three point eight five to slow down inflation
[transcript:00:38:51] Which is making my monthly payment a little more expensive home purchasing is becoming a little less accessible to the median
[transcript:00:38:57] But I still have this cool house. Okay, let's go back to this super useful graph that tells us how the economic spoils are being shared
[keyframe:00:39:00] The video frame shows a man standing in front of a graph labeled "Family Income Growth by Group." The graph displays lines representing different income groups, with annotations highlighting "Top Earners," "Middle Earners," and "Low Earners." The setting appears to be a presentation or informational segment, and the atmosphere is analytical, focusing on income disparities.
[transcript:00:39:03] Remember that's me the median income earner
[transcript:00:39:07] Yeah, but what we shared the point of the share though at the same rate as the high income and low income earners in our country
[transcript:00:39:14] The growing economy is being shared by these different income groups. It's actually pretty impressive how like
[transcript:00:39:20] Tight everything is moving together as the economy grows. Oh, and look they've started collecting
[transcript:00:39:24] On the growth of the shares CEOs are making than the typical employee looks like by the middle of the decade
[transcript:00:39:29] It's about 26 times more wait our CEOs making too much is that bad? What do you think companies are also let's keep an eye on this chart
[keyframe:00:39:30] The video frame features a man standing with folded arms in front of a chart labeled "GDP per typical worker," which shows a line graph against a blue background. In the bottom left corner, there is a smaller inset showing someone wearing headphones and speaking into a microphone, suggesting a live commentary or reaction. The mood appears informative and analytical, emphasizing a focus on economic data presentation and discussion.
[transcript:00:39:37] Well companies are also getting bigger and there's less top companies
[transcript:00:39:43] By ratio. I mean this is down this is down happy come on break in a sense
[transcript:00:39:46] This is the right is it is the right okay, but what about the American dream? How easy it is to make more than your parents?
[transcript:00:39:51] Well, if I'm an adult in the 1970s it means that was born in the 1950s
[transcript:00:39:55] Which according to this data set means I'm 80% likely to earn more than my parents. That's still amazing
[keyframe:00:40:00] The image features a man gesturing as he stands in front of a large chart displaying a downward-sloping line, titled "LIKELIHOOD OF EARNING MORE THAN PARENTS." The environment appears to be a presentation or educational setting, with the man likely explaining socioeconomic trends. The atmosphere is analytical and informational, emphasizing data-driven insights into economic mobility.
[transcript:00:40:01] Good the American dream seems to be doing pretty well
[transcript:00:40:03] So I would say that economic life in the 1970s is better for the median earner than it was in the 50s
[transcript:00:40:09] And something that we're not covering here because we're looking at the cold hard data is that there's also a revolution happening
[transcript:00:40:14] That's making it more equal and more fair for minority groups in the United States
[transcript:00:40:19] So these are good trends. Let's see how they continue as we move on to the 1990s. I know
[transcript:00:40:30] To get to the 90s we have to go through the 80s and look at group that say if I speak over
[keyframe:00:40:30] The video frame features a collage of nostalgic and futuristic elements, including a large, yellow vintage bus in the foreground. In the background, there's a mix of pop culture references such as a "Star Wars" poster, a flying car, and a futuristic cityscape with billboards and graphs. The overall mood is eclectic and whimsical, blending elements of retro aesthetics with futuristic themes.
[transcript:00:40:35] Should I get your your your your just your just weird you just weird you have no idea what anybody is capable of
[transcript:00:40:40] You did everybody the same chance you have your gents imagine the amount of max wins you're losing out on it. You say oh
[transcript:00:40:48] Decivil campus. Do you guys can't do this? Oh, what what it's a loss for the the the the second of what of them?
[transcript:00:40:54] You're just stupid
[transcript:00:40:56] The president has been very busy slashing taxes getting rid of regulation and social programs and rejiggering the economy to benefit businesses
[keyframe:00:41:00] The frame features a graph titled "Real GDP Per Capita" prominently displayed, showcasing economic trends over time with a notable upward trajectory highlighted in gold. In the background, a subdued setting includes a person seated, slightly obscured, creating a contrast between the serious economic data and a more casual environment. The overall mood is informative, emphasizing economic growth, while the setting adds a personal, perhaps reflective touch.
[transcript:00:41:03] Making it harder for workers to like gather and get leverage over their employers
[transcript:00:41:10] And look we are arriving to the 1990s what a great decade
[transcript:00:41:16] Hi me again. I'm out of the collage world because
[transcript:00:41:21] It's Johnny here. Let's leave my room full of maps and get back into the 1990s
[transcript:00:41:29] The big standoff between the United States and the Soviet Union is over and people are stoked
[keyframe:00:41:30] The video frame features a collage-like urban setting with a mix of elements including a "Blockbuster" sign and a chart depicting a rising trend, suggesting a focus on growth or nostalgia. In the background, there's a cityscape with buildings and a sky, while a person is visible in the lower left corner, seated possibly in an indoor space with screens. The mood is dynamic and somewhat surreal, combining modern digital elements with retro visuals.
[transcript:00:41:35] We enter the 1990s with this little recession
[transcript:00:41:37] We're getting ready for a big surge of more growth thanks to the rise of the internet
[transcript:00:41:42] Is where it's at playing the role of the middle income earner. Okay, so it's not like I was like born back in the 50s
[transcript:00:41:48] And I've been growing up. I am a young adult who was the middle income earner
[transcript:00:41:53] How am I doing? So I still work at a factory America is still a manufacturing powerhouse here in the 90s
[transcript:00:41:58] Though that is literally right about to change. I wish I could mourn myself
[keyframe:00:42:00] The video frame depicts a man standing in a warehouse filled with rows of stacked crates and boxes. In the background, an animated figure wearing a yellow hat seems to be gesturing or pointing, adding a whimsical element to the industrial setting. The mood is a mix of realism and surrealism, combining the gritty, organized atmosphere of a storage facility with the playful presence of the animated character.
[transcript:00:42:01] My household brings in $76,000 a year
[transcript:00:42:04] Which is definitely better than the 50s and 60s
[transcript:00:42:08] But you can kind of see that things are flattening out and in fact
[transcript:00:42:12] I'm not making that much more than I was in the late 70s. Check out my cool 90s house
[transcript:00:42:17] Cost me $273,000. That's almost four times our yearly income way more expensive than in the 50s
[transcript:00:42:24] Housing is getting a little less affordable. Okay, the economy is doing well. How are we sharing all of this economic prosperity?
[transcript:00:42:30] Yeah, they also don't say
[keyframe:00:42:30] The video frame features a man in the foreground speaking, seemingly giving a presentation or explanation. He stands in front of a graph titled "Family Income Growth by Group," which shows data comparisons among different income levels. Inset in the bottom left corner is another person, perhaps in a livestream or commentary setting. The atmosphere is informative, with a focus on data visualization and communication.
[transcript:00:42:34] And I've to almost forgot something back in the days. That was that was the household income
[transcript:00:42:39] But back in days women didn't really work
[transcript:00:42:41] So that was one man two years
[transcript:00:42:45] At one man income is house now it's four years at two guys. Oh, he said down. Okay
[transcript:00:42:50] Now now it's two years now it's four years as two and that's eight x
[transcript:00:42:54] We started back in the 50s and we saw that's a 4x that's four x
[transcript:00:42:57] The low income and me the middle income. We all saw similar growth in eight x
[keyframe:00:43:00] The video frame features a person gesturing while standing beside a graph titled "Family Income Growth by Group." The graph displays lines labeled for different income groups, highlighting disparities over time. The setting appears to be educational or informative, with a text-heavy background suggesting an analytical or data-driven atmosphere.
[transcript:00:43:02] We all got in on economic growth equally that continued through the 70s
[transcript:00:43:06] But wait look what happens right here
[transcript:00:43:11] All right
[transcript:00:43:13] They're diverging
[transcript:00:43:15] It's around the 1980s when you see the top earners start to pull away from the rest of the population is going up faster than mine
[transcript:00:43:22] And my income is going up a little faster than the low income population. Okay, that's unsettling
[transcript:00:43:27] I liked it more when they were all kind of like on top of each other growing at the same rate
[transcript:00:43:30] We'll keep an eye on this graph
[keyframe:00:43:30] The video frame features a person standing in front of a large graph titled "Family Income Growth by Group," with lines indicating different income earners' trends over time. The room appears to be a simple indoor setting with a soft, neutral background, possibly an office or living room, as suggested by the minimalistic decor. The mood is analytical and informative, focusing on economic data visualization, highlighted by the serious expression of the main subject and the presence of the graph.
[transcript:00:43:31] But there's a bunch of other graphs starting to come out another divergence happened
[transcript:00:43:35] Yo other countries mid maxed lowest possible
[transcript:00:43:40] Uh
[transcript:00:43:41] Quality of life for the humans out of her and a max production
[transcript:00:43:45] You we got out meta that is what it is. What is active the economy versus how much I get paid
[transcript:00:43:50] They're both going up at the same time. I'm more productive. I get paid more cool
[transcript:00:43:54] But around the same time the same split happens
[transcript:00:43:57] My pay starts the flat line. I think it's a true though productivity continues to go up
[keyframe:00:44:00] The video frame features a man in a white shirt gesturing as he explains a graph titled "Productivity vs Wages," which shows diverging red and blue lines. The setting includes a simple blue background with a small inset image of another person in a cozy room, possibly providing an informal or informational atmosphere. The overall mood suggests an educational or analytical tone, focusing on the data presented in the graph.
[transcript:00:44:01] So then there's this period that starts around 1979 in the early 80s where we see this pulling apart
[transcript:00:44:09] between economic growth
[transcript:00:44:11] and what typical workers and their families
[transcript:00:44:14] Receive from that economic growth. So who's getting in on all this extra productivity
[transcript:00:44:19] This growth that's happening in our economy if not me. Well, let's check it on those CEOs
[transcript:00:44:24] So remember back in the 70s CEOs were making like 25 times more than the typical worker kind of seems like a lot
[transcript:00:44:30] Let's see what happens here. Oh my god. Look at this
[keyframe:00:44:30] The video frame features a person in the foreground gesturing, with a graph displaying "CEO Pay vs. Typical Worker" as the backdrop, illustrating a rising trend line. The setting appears to be informal, with another person visible in a smaller inset on the left, seemingly engaged in discussion or listening. The atmosphere conveys a sense of explanation or analysis, focusing on economic disparity.
[transcript:00:44:33] Okay, whoa by the end of the 90s CEOs are making almost 400 times the typical worker
[transcript:00:44:38] And I thought 20 times was a lot. Okay
[transcript:00:44:42] Hold on and ask let me ask but what about the size of their companies though
[transcript:00:44:47] Did they do their companies now have more employees or not?
[transcript:00:44:51] I feel like hold on with globalization or whatever
[transcript:00:44:54] These companies have now more employees. It's a bigger infrastructure. So the pyramid
[transcript:00:45:00] Yes, it's steep at the top, but it's larger at the bottom
[keyframe:00:45:00] The video frame shows a person standing in front of a graph labeled "CEO Pay vs. Typical Worker," which indicates a steep upward trend. The background is minimalist, focusing attention on both the person, who appears to be discussing the chart, and the graph itself. The mood is analytical and critical, likely addressing economic disparities, enhanced by the visual contrast between the individual and the stark data presented.
[transcript:00:45:06] So by if you compare yet the top that the bottom is bad
[transcript:00:45:09] But it's a lot much larger pyramid
[transcript:00:45:12] Those at the top are receiving much larger shares of that growing economy
[transcript:00:45:18] The nose at the middle or at the bottom of the wage distribution
[transcript:00:45:21] So that pulling apart that increasing economic inequality is not a take it is apparent. Well, it's not it's a pyramid
[transcript:00:45:29] Bro if you have a three three
[keyframe:00:45:30] The video frame shows a woman with curly gray hair and a black top as the main subject, appearing to engage in conversation or presentation, likely via a video call.

The atmosphere appears focused and slightly casual, indicative of a remote meeting or discussion.
[transcript:00:45:32] slice pyramid
[transcript:00:45:34] Top the bottom is only three layers yet you're closer to bottom
[transcript:00:45:37] But if you're massive
[transcript:00:45:39] Pyramid get it fucking 60 slice you got the top one's a lot more than not in the bottom
[transcript:00:45:43] It's just the way it is no no matter how you look at it that
[transcript:00:45:47] High is going increasingly to the very top
[transcript:00:45:50] Okay, okay, but
[transcript:00:45:52] Is an inequality often seen as a byproduct of rapid economic growth? Could this be a good thing for our economy?
[transcript:00:45:59] Yes, people are getting really good because they're innovating and making our economy more productive
[keyframe:00:46:00] The video frame features a man in the foreground wearing a white shirt, gesturing as he discusses or presents something. He is set against an edited background that combines urban elements with skyscrapers and smaller screens showing various scenes, including a person with a camera and a man holding a smartphone. The mood appears dynamic and engaging, suggesting a blend of technology and urban lifestyle themes.
[transcript:00:46:04] And plus everything I've shown you is before taxes guys. So like the rich pay a lot of taxes
[transcript:00:46:09] Okay, so let's see what happens to the income of the rich people after taxes here we go
[transcript:00:46:16] Oh, okay
[transcript:00:46:18] well
[transcript:00:46:22] The the taxes didn't do that much
[transcript:00:46:26] There's something going on here the rich are getting really rich really fast. I mean
[keyframe:00:46:30] The frame features a man in a white sweater standing in front of a flat blue background, next to a chart labeled "Income After Tax." The line graph on the chart shows two lines, with one labeled "Finland" above the other. In the bottom left corner, a smaller inset shows another individual at a desk, appearing contemplative, with a computing setup visible. The overall mood is informative, suggesting an analytical or educational theme.
[transcript:00:46:31] What these lines all show is that
[transcript:00:46:34] 1980 was kind of this inflection point in our economy where the top earners kind of
[transcript:00:46:39] Started to get in on most of the prosperity triple trickle down. I can I is brain dead at
[transcript:00:46:44] Stomp roll and yes
[transcript:00:46:46] I know he thinks it's not either
[transcript:00:46:48] Is in bad for an economy actually spurs growth and investment into the economy and eventually that raises all
[transcript:00:46:55] Trichol's down and advocate yo, do you trickle like I his brain get it one and you even in motion
[transcript:00:47:00] They even think that people have to have more money spend more

[transcript:00:47:04] Roll people would sell their grandma not to spend money when I don't even bother at the top
[transcript:00:47:09] It's fucking weird. It's weird. It's weird. It's what I know the right way of thinking say that we shouldn't focus on inequality
[transcript:00:47:14] But instead on poverty reduction, okay, but that's what happens how we doing a horrible
[transcript:00:47:19] plummeted after World War two
[transcript:00:47:21] But you can see that at this time like 1980 when inequality starts to get really bad
[transcript:00:47:26] poverty basically
[transcript:00:47:28] Stays the same goes up for big series of years
[keyframe:00:47:30] The video frame features a man in a white sweater standing in front of a large chart labeled "Americans in Poverty," which displays a downward trend. The background is a plain blue, creating a neutral setting. A smaller inset image shows another person in an indoor space, suggesting a video call or commentary, contributing to a focused and informative atmosphere.
[transcript:00:47:32] So this is concerning and this is my interpretation of the data
[transcript:00:47:37] I'm sure some of you have very different interpretations and I would love to see you down in the comments
[transcript:00:47:41] Anyway, let's check in on the American dream
[transcript:00:47:44] Miami problem chance that I've been a people that are rich making too much money the promise of the now spending
[transcript:00:47:49] I know this will sound like a dumb take I have more of a problem that
[transcript:00:47:53] Of people not spending money than then making more more money
[transcript:00:47:57] I have a problem with them making a lot more money you know you do that you do this or whatever
[transcript:00:48:00] You're giving system you make money is what it is right how about you fucking spend it before you before you die
[keyframe:00:48:00] The frame features three main subjects: two individuals standing together in the middle ground, with one person slightly in front of them in the foreground. The background suggests a suburban setting with a house visible behind them. The visual elements include casual clothing, and the mood appears contemplative or thought-provoking, enhanced by the focus on the individuals' expressions.
[transcript:00:48:05] Yeah, there's no there's no life 2.0 waste your money
[transcript:00:48:09] It's what it's meant to do to you is mother's just going and fucking just blow it up a big risk big reward
[transcript:00:48:16] So yeah, inequality is happening, but like if you can go from rags to riches
[transcript:00:48:22] Maybe that's very American and okay
[transcript:00:48:24] If I was born in 1970s, I'm now an adult in the name the children that we don't care
[transcript:00:48:28] We don't care you went you were at a spot you got to someplace. I don't give a shit
[keyframe:00:48:30] The frame features two main subjects: a person standing to the right, speaking, and a smaller video inset showing another individual sitting and reacting. The setting appears to be an informative presentation, with a large graph displayed in the background, titled "LIKELIHOOD OF EARNING MORE THAN PARENTS (FOR THOSE BORN INTO MEDIAN INCOME)." The atmosphere is analytical and educational, focusing on data visualization and commentary.
[transcript:00:48:33] You're gonna work for your money. I don't give a fuck
[transcript:00:48:35] I'm like you don't get a free pass to the fucking tub you fucking loser
[transcript:00:48:37] If I'm having children and fucking and in spawning at the fucking top layer
[transcript:00:48:41] I'll give a shit fucking bitch ass. Yo, get to the coal mines. Our fucking diggin loser fuck
[transcript:00:48:45] What is on this guy and the data says that 59% of us born to the middle income will out earn our parents
[transcript:00:48:52] So that means that 40% of my peers here in the middle income
[transcript:00:48:57] Will earn the same or less than their parents yo, I will do an Easter egg hunt
[keyframe:00:49:00] The video frame depicts an animated scene with two groups of people labeled as "Middle Income Earners." The setting appears to be an urban environment, possibly a street or plaza, with a large building and a billboard in the background. Key visual elements include text highlighting economic categories and the casual attire of the characters, creating an informative and analytical atmosphere.
[transcript:00:49:02] Full of money with all my fuck with my my lifetime earning it before I give that shit to my children are you kidding me?
[transcript:00:49:07] What a joke even as we are seeing all of this economic growth
[transcript:00:49:11] I mean you can see this trend here the American dream of being able to move up the ladder is becoming
[transcript:00:49:18] Less and less a reality for a bigger and bigger portion of the population
[transcript:00:49:23] Okay, so that was a big change from all the trends. Yeah, let's see what happens next
[transcript:00:49:29] People assume the time is a strict program of course to effect but actually it's more like a big bowl of we be wobbly
[keyframe:00:49:30] The video frame presents an urban setting with a mix of modern and commercial elements. A person in the foreground, casually dressed, appears to be skateboarding across the scene. Behind them, there are prominent billboards and buildings, featuring a movie poster and a graph, adding a dynamic and busy atmosphere. To the right, a black car enters the frame, enhancing the sense of motion and urban life. Overall, the scene conveys a lively and bustling city vibe.
[transcript:00:49:35] Timey-wimey stop okay. We're moving into the new millennium America's fighting a couple of wars the economy is actually doing pretty well until
[transcript:00:49:43] Whoops whoa the banker's got a little Lucy Goosey for a couple of years making obscene amounts of money and crashing the entire world economy
[transcript:00:49:49] But okay, we'll move on from the biggest recession of our time we're arriving
[transcript:00:49:54] This is a world that most of us are familiar with let's see how the median income earner fairs
[keyframe:00:50:00] The frame features a man standing in front of a digitally altered cityscape with various billboards behind him. One prominent billboard features animated characters from a recognizable movie series. The setting gives a lively, urban atmosphere, with bright colors and a playful, energetic mood.
[transcript:00:50:02] Yeah, it gets pretty bad here. I think all of those jobs have dried up and been shipped to Asia
[transcript:00:50:07] So I now work as a middle manager at an insurance company and my household income is $81,000 a year
[transcript:00:50:13] Which is wait a minute same as 1997 but wait during this same 13 year period from 1997 to 2010 the economy grew by this much
[transcript:00:50:21] I mean that I just want to see what is the woman at work ratio is also
[transcript:00:50:26] Because now I'm thinking they put a lot more women at work yet the
[keyframe:00:50:30] The image features two main subjects: a person on the right gesturing towards a large chart titled "The American Economy," showing a line graph of GDP from 1945 to 2010. The setting is likely an educational or informative video, given the chart and presentation style. The backdrop is simple, with a light blue wall creating a focused, instructional atmosphere, while the smaller inset image of another person adds a layer of interaction or commentary.
[transcript:00:50:32] House income is the same lines going up the economy is making more stuff is more prosperity even when you adjust for inflation per capita
[transcript:00:50:39] The economy grew is a problem there should be more to go around
[transcript:00:50:42] But my household pay is the same as it was 13 years previous
[transcript:00:50:47] Why well we'll see in a second, but first let's talk about my house. I always love talking about my house
[transcript:00:50:53] Look at this beauty. I can still afford a house in fact here in like
[transcript:00:50:57] Post recession America housing prices are
[keyframe:00:51:00] The video frame features a man standing in front of a blue background, with a large chart displayed beside him. The chart shows a line graph labeled "Median House Price in U.S." with an overall upward trend. In the bottom left corner, a smaller inset shows a person in a different setting, possibly an office, contributing to an informative and analytical atmosphere.
[transcript:00:51:02] Actually pretty low the bubble burst interest rates had to go down to stimulate the economy
[transcript:00:51:07] And so home purchase seems was actually pretty accessible for a few years
[transcript:00:51:11] But don't worry housing prices will be back on the rise in a second and in fact
[transcript:00:51:15] They'll start rising faster than my income making housing less and less affordable and homeownerships still seems to be
[transcript:00:51:23] Available mostly for certain groups and not as much for others in fact that hasn't changed much since the segregation days
[keyframe:00:51:30] The video frame features a man in the foreground, gesturing as he appears to be explaining a concept. Behind him is a projected chart titled "Home Ownership Rates by Race" displaying various colored lines. The setting has a simple blue backdrop, with an inset of another person visible in the bottom left corner, seemingly focused on the primary speaker, contributing to an informative and analytical atmosphere.
[transcript:00:51:31] Meanwhile, I think I know what's gonna happen to this graph
[transcript:00:51:34] What if all the residents of a certain like village or like neighborhood
[transcript:00:51:38] We make a co-op everybody puts money to a pot right
[transcript:00:51:42] And we buy all the houses
[transcript:00:51:44] We get bigger loans is we're we're bigger group
[transcript:00:51:47] And we do crowd funded house sorting
[transcript:00:51:51] Yeah, the rich are just getting richer faster than my income is going up and my income is kind of stagnating
[transcript:00:51:58] Okay, what about the CEOs? They do they pay a price for the big bubble person?
[keyframe:00:52:00] The video frame shows a man standing in front of a graph labeled "CEO Pay vs. Typical Worker," which depicts a steep upward trend. The setting seems to be an educational or presentation environment, with a simple blue backdrop and a framed chart. The mood is informative and slightly critical, emphasized by the serious expression of the man focusing on the data displayed.
[transcript:00:52:02] Nope, they didn't I mean they kind of did up and down
[transcript:00:52:04] But they're still by the end of the decade getting paid hundreds of times more than me
[transcript:00:52:08] It's not all right. There are hundreds of times more productive and they deserve it
[transcript:00:52:14] No, no, I'm talking we buy houses or then and then or or or we sell them
[transcript:00:52:19] And then you do a bunch of gunshots and never heard right or whatever you increase crime
[transcript:00:52:24] artificially right like fake crimes or whatever
[transcript:00:52:26] The price of the houses go down you buy them back
[transcript:00:52:29] Right no more crime all of a sudden because you you're your your your you start the guys stuff
[keyframe:00:52:30] The video frame shows a graph comparing productivity and wages over time, with two lines—red for productivity and blue for wages—depicting a growing gap. In the corner, a person is visible, seemingly delivering a presentation or commentary, sitting in a well-furnished room. The atmosphere is analytical, focusing on economic trends and disparities, as conveyed by the graph and accompanying text.
[transcript:00:52:33] It's not to take crime and then you sell them again
[transcript:00:52:37] Holy shit. I mean chat that is insane. This is what we've been hearing about for a long time
[transcript:00:52:42] All of these graphs have the same shape
[transcript:00:52:45] This great divergence that happens in the 80s where the economy is growing
[transcript:00:52:50] But the wages for the average person just kind of flatten while the top earners just sort of get in on all yeah
[transcript:00:52:57] That's fraud so what what about fraud if the top 1% all do fraud why why can't the bomb do it?
[keyframe:00:53:00] The video frame features a graph titled "Income After Tax" as its main subject, showing trends for different income brackets over time, with the top 1% visibly increasing. In the bottom left corner, there’s a person seated in front of a computer, appearing engaged or focused, possibly streaming or recording a commentary. The setting is a casual indoor environment with subdued lighting, creating an informative and analytical atmosphere.
[transcript:00:53:03] They can do fraud. Okay fraud too. Okay, okay, okay, but the American dream. No equalized fraud
[transcript:00:53:09] Right, so if you're born in the 1980s, which I was you're now an adult in the 2010s
[transcript:00:53:14] and
[transcript:00:53:16] It looks like for the median earner the majority of us will earn the same or less than our parents. Yeah, this is a
[transcript:00:53:24] problem and
[transcript:00:53:26] Probably doesn't seem fair to a lot of people, but wait there's hope start
[transcript:00:53:30] Terminator time time after to calmly
[keyframe:00:53:30] The video frame depicts a bustling urban street setting with colorful buildings and a large billboard displaying a graph labeled "Real GDP Per Capita." A skateboarder is captured in mid-action in the foreground, adding a dynamic element to the scene. The atmosphere feels lively and modern, with a blend of commercial imagery and city life.
[transcript:00:53:33] Somewhere in time time time time time machine. Okay. I'm back
[transcript:00:53:38] 2025 that's when I'm making this video. So that's modern day for me
[transcript:00:53:42] We went through a pandemic the economy kind of got freaked out for a little bit and the median income earner
[transcript:00:53:47] Actually started to see some gains after years and years of flatlining. So you do see some
[transcript:00:53:54] Potential movement here some hope, but let's get back to the original question that we started this video with is the average
[transcript:00:54:00] Quack I would comment chat because I feel like if you rob a store. Okay
[keyframe:00:54:00] The main subject of the video frame is a person standing in the foreground, wearing a light-colored sweater, gesturing with their hands. The setting is indoors, with a warmly lit, cozy atmosphere, featuring a cluttered background that includes a plant, soft lighting, and a bulletin board with various items. The visual elements and relaxed ambiance suggest an informal, conversational mood.
[transcript:00:54:04] For like five thousand dollars you get clapped to get mega jail like or maybe second offense. You get mega jail
[transcript:00:54:10] How come you don't get clapped that hard when you don't pay your tax and you fraudulent
[transcript:00:54:15] Say a five million dollars and you're back your behind on your back. That's like fucking three years
[transcript:00:54:21] And you're skimming the government and they can't anything get you. Okay, you get
[transcript:00:54:24] 44 years in jail. Well, that's it. Well done. Oh, oh, oh, you didn't want to go to jail. Oh, I'm about it
[transcript:00:54:30] Then don't do fraud it. It's that some it's that simple

The background includes a wall covered with pinned maps and scattered papers, suggesting an investigative or analytical theme. The warm, ambient lighting combined with the casual setting creates a reflective and introspective mood.
[transcript:00:54:35] American better off now than they were back in the fifties and over these
[transcript:00:54:40] Problemed about in a lot of ways the answer is yes
[transcript:00:54:43] Especially if you are a woman or not white then the answer is yes in at least in terms of economic opportunity
[transcript:00:54:50] But what we've seen on this journey is that the American economy has produced an incredible amount of prosperity in growth over these last seven decades
[transcript:00:54:59] And that was shared broadly by all of us for a time
[keyframe:00:55:00] The video frame features a man in a white sweater standing in a warmly lit room, with a map and various photos pinned to a corkboard behind him. A smaller inset shows another person in a casual pose, watching attentively. The setting and elements suggest an investigative or documentary style, creating an atmosphere of curiosity and focus.
[transcript:00:55:04] But in the last 30 40 years the data is very clear that the fruits of the economic growth these days
[transcript:00:55:12] Have not been broadly shared one group is collecting most of the growth and I didn't even talk about wealth
[transcript:00:55:20] Like the stuff you just own and how that makes okay, check isn't this this I can point a little bit like a zero sum
[transcript:00:55:26] We're talking just about income on this now. This isn't the first time
[transcript:00:55:30] That we've been in the situation the top 10 percent collected almost half of all the income way back in the early 1900s before World War II
[keyframe:00:55:30] The frame features two main subjects: a person in the foreground passionately speaking or presenting, and another individual in the lower-left corner, focused on a task at a desk setup. The setting appears to be an indoor space, with the central area dominated by a graph titled "Income Inequality in the U.S." in the background. The visual elements, including the chart and the presenters' expressions, create an informative and slightly intense atmosphere, indicative of a discussion or analysis on economic topics.
[transcript:00:55:38] But we changed that
[transcript:00:55:40] Well, I'm a dumb
[transcript:00:55:43] And the income starts to be distributed what the this talking point is like if these guys
[transcript:00:55:49] Uh uh uh didn't make that amount of money
[transcript:00:55:52] Or whatever that amount would go to the bottom. They're they're money should be hours that doesn't that's not how that works
[transcript:00:56:00] More equally, but this graph tells the same story looked 1980 boom here goes we're back
[keyframe:00:56:00] The video frame features two main subjects: a man in the bottom left corner working at a computer and another person on the right side whose image is superimposed over a graph. The graph, titled "Income Inequality in the U.S.," displays data on the share of national income going to the top 10%. The setting appears to be a digital environment, with the overlay suggesting a discussion or analysis, creating an informative and analytical mood.
[transcript:00:56:06] We're back to where we were oh
[transcript:00:56:09] Now does this mean that our economy is broken? No actually our economy is not broken
[transcript:00:56:14] It is working exactly how it was designed to work and this and this and this and this and this it's the result of
[transcript:00:56:23] Changes to the rules policies that end up determining who gets the money and who doesn't these policies are made
[transcript:00:56:29] By people that we elect and if we don't think that this is fair
[keyframe:00:56:30] The video frame shows a person in a white shirt standing in front of a graph titled "INCOME AFTER TAX." The graph illustrates income trends over time, with lines labeled "Top 1%," "Middle 40%," and "Bottom 50%." In the corner, there's a smaller inset showing another person seemingly engaged in conversation or explanation, contributing to an informative and analytical atmosphere.
[transcript:00:56:33] We have the power to pressure them to design a system that is fair now the medium income earner doesn't have newly as much power these
[transcript:00:56:42] So what about a dynamic minimum wage based on how successful a company is and it it goes up and down
[transcript:00:56:51] Dynamically with the state of everything
[transcript:00:56:54] Days the top income earners and the corporations have really gotten their foot in the door for the people have the power to set the rules
[keyframe:00:57:00] The video frame features a person standing and speaking directly to the camera, creating an engaging and focused atmosphere. The setting appears to be an indoor space with a warm, inviting ambiance, enhanced by soft lighting, a decorated bulletin board, and plants in the background. Inset in the bottom left corner, a smaller frame shows an individual gesturing, possibly providing commentary or a reaction, adding a dynamic element to the scene.
[transcript:00:57:02] So it's harder than ever, but this still is a democracy
[transcript:00:57:04] Oh that's a bad idea
[transcript:00:57:05] You can system is fair
[transcript:00:57:06] How many times is it okay?
[transcript:00:57:07] Okay, then then I'll do it then I'll do it like we're doing in these days and the more money we make it the less
[transcript:00:57:12] I give a shit by everybody and did you guys get fucked up even harder and I'm making more money
[transcript:00:57:18] I'm saying I want you to fucking even harder as much as I can actually we still have now
[transcript:00:57:24] We're here now. We're here now. Sure are politicians to change it and it's not actually just about income inequality
[transcript:00:57:29] Yes, that has risen the rich get richer much faster
[keyframe:00:57:30] The video frame shows two main subjects: a person in the foreground speaking to the camera and another in a smaller inset frame, likely engaged in a live stream or video call. The setting appears to be a cozy, warmly lit room with a large map and a corkboard covered in papers in the background, suggesting a home office or creative workspace. The mood is focused and professional, with an inviting atmosphere due to the warm lighting and organized environment.
[transcript:00:57:32] It's also about the American dream this idea of being able to move up if you get educated if you work hard
[transcript:00:57:40] As inequality has gone up the American dream has gone down
[transcript:00:57:45] These graphs are built on robust data and this is the story that it tells the rungs of the economic ladder
[transcript:00:57:52] Have gotten wider and wider apart and that American dream
[transcript:00:57:57] Ironically a term coined by a rich investment banker born into a rich family in New York City
