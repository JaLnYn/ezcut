Picture this: a tech event buzzing with excitement, where one person takes a heroic bite of pizza, eyes sparkling with joy. The black lanyard around their neck shouts “HackAToronto,” but all that matters in this moment is the cheesy delight. Who knew happiness could be found in a slice? 

Now, switch gears to a serene car ride through the urban jungle. A bustling city unfolds outside, where delivery trucks weave among skyscrapers, all under the watchful gaze of a dashcam. Life hums along, muted colors blending like a soothing backdrop to the daily grind. Amidst the chaos, a calm routine unfolds, reminding us that even in the hustle, there’s beauty in the ordinary.
